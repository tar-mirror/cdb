How to install dcache
       This  document  describes  how  to  download, compile, test and install
       dcache.


   System requirements:
       The dcache package is meant to run under UNIX and -lookalikes.



   Create a /package directory:
	 $ mkdir /package
	 $ chmod 1755 /package
	 $ cd /package
       You may use another directory. No program in the dcache	package	 cares
       where it is installed. /package is recommended.

       The latest published dcache package is:

       http://www.ohse.de/uwe/dcache/dcache-0.6.2.tar.gz

       You can alternatively download it through FTP:

       ftp://www.ohse.de/uwe/dcache/dcache-0.6.2.tar.gz



   Unpack the package:
	 $ gunzip dcache-0.6.2.tar.gz
	 $ tar -xpf dcache-0.6.2.tar
	 $ rm dcache-0.6.2.tar
	 $ cd data/dcache-0.6.2


   Compile and install the programs:
	 $ package/install


   Where commands and documentation are installed:
       By	default	     the      binaries	    are	     installed	    in
       /package/dcache-0.6.2/commmand.	(replace /package/  by	the  directory
       where  you  you unpacked the dcache distribution in). Symbolic links to
       the commands are created in /command/ and, for  compatibility  reasons,
       in /usr/local/bin.
       Manual pages are installed in /package/dcache-0.6.2/doc. Symbolic links
       to the manual pages are created under /usr/local/man.

       If you don't like this then:
	 $ package/compile && package/check
	 $ cp command/* /whereever/you/want/bin
	 $ cp doc/* /whereever/you/want/doc



   Self check:
       compile/install (or compile/check) try to run some automated tests.  If
       these tests fail the software will not be installed.

       The  tests  take	 some  time.  Things  are  fine	 if  they do not print
       anything.


   How to report success: (not mandatory)
	 $ cat compile/auto-systype* | mail uwe-generic-counter@ohse.de

       Please do not send this email if the self-check failed. Send a  problem
       report to the mailing list instead.



   Cleaning up:
       If  you	are  short  on	disk  space you may remove the compile and src
       directories:
	 $ rm -rf compile src



   Mailing list:
       To subscribe to	the  dcache  mailing  list  send  a  mail  to  dcache-
       subscribe@lists.ohse.de. The content is ignored.

       You  do	not  need to subscribe to the mailing list, it is an open one.
       But, if you are not subscribed, make sure to mention this in the	 mail.

       Please include the dcache version number, the operating system and it's
       version and any	possible  relevant  output  of	the  failing  program.
       Please include compile/systype in your posting.

       If  your system is a GNU/Linux one then please include name and version
       of your distribution and your C library version number (as  printed  by
       ldd --version).
