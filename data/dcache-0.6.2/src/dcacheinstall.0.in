.section "How to install dcache"
.paragraph
This document describes how to download, compile, test and install dcache.
.subsection "System requirements:"
The dcache package is meant to run under UNIX and -lookalikes.
.paragraph
.subsection "Create a /package directory:"
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ mkdir /package
  $ chmod 1755 /package
  $ cd /package
.HTML </pre>
.fi
You may use another directory. No program in the dcache package cares
where it is installed. /package is recommended.
.paragraph
.subscection "Download dcache:"
The latest published dcache package is:
.paragraph
.extlink http://www.ohse.de/uwe/\*(PA/\*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz \*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz
.paragraph
You can alternatively download it through FTP:
.paragraph
.extlink ftp://www.ohse.de/uwe/\*(PA/\*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz \*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz
.paragraph
.subsection "Unpack the package:"
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ gunzip \*(PA-\*(VE.tar.gz 
  $ tar -xpf \*(PA-\*(VE.tar
  $ rm \*(PA-\*(VE.tar
  $ cd \*(CL/\*(PA-\*(VE
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.subsection "Compile and install the programs:"
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ package/install
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.subsection "Where commands and documentation are installed:"
By default the binaries are installed in \fB/package/\*(PA-\*(VE/commmand\fR.
(replace /package/ by the directory where you you unpacked the dcache 
distribution in). Symbolic links to the commands are created in 
\fB/command/\fR and, for compatibility reasons, in \fB/usr/local/bin\fR.
.br
Manual pages are installed in \fB/package/\*(PA-\*(VE/doc\fR. Symbolic
links to the manual pages are created under \fB/usr/local/man\fR.
.paragraph
If you don't like this then:
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ package/compile && package/check
  $ cp command/* /whereever/you/want/bin
  $ cp doc/* /whereever/you/want/doc
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.paragraph
.subsection "Self check:"
\fBcompile/install\fR (or \fBcompile/check\fR) try to run some automated 
tests. If these
tests fail the software will not be installed.
.paragraph
The tests take some time. Things are fine if they do not print anything.
.subsection "How to report success: (not mandatory)"
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ cat compile/auto-systype* | mail uwe-generic-counter@ohse.de
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.paragraph
Please do not send this email if the self-check failed. Send a
problem report to the mailing list instead.
.paragraph
.subsection "Cleaning up:"
If you are short on disk space you may remove the compile and src 
directories:
.nf
.HTML <pre>
  $ rm -rf compile src
.HTML </pre>
.fi
.paragraph
.subsection "Mailing list:"
To subscribe to the dcache mailing list send a mail to
\fBdcache-subscribe@lists.ohse.de\fR. The content is ignored.
.paragraph
You do not need to subscribe to the mailing list, it is an open one.
But, if you are not subscribed, make sure to mention this in the mail.
.paragraph
Please include the dcache version number, the operating system and
it's version and any possible relevant output of the failing program.
Please include compile/systype in your posting.
.paragraph
If your system is a GNU/Linux one then please include name and
version of your distribution and your C library version number (as
printed by ldd --version).
