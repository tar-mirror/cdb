.SH NAME
An introduction to dcache.
.section DESCRIPTION
A dcache is a disk based caching database in a single file containing a
header and fixed sized hash and data space.
.paragraph
The header holds variables and constants describing the database.
.paragraph
The hash table holds pointers into the data area and hashes
of the keys. The hash function used is a crc32.
.paragraph
The data area consists of the data, the key, a 64bit number with
application defined use, and two 32bit numbers holding key and
data lengths.
.paragraph
The header and hash table are mapped into process address space
using the mmap(2) system call. The data area is not memory mapped,
thus allowing to handle multi-gigabyte files even on systems with
a 32bit address space.

Limitations and features
.list
.entry "The database size is limited to 63 bits on operating systems supporting"
large files.
.entry "The database size is limited to 31 bits (2 gigabytes) on operating"
systems not supporting large files.
.entry "The sum of the length of key, data and record overhead is limited to"
31 bits (2 gigabytes).
.entry "The record overhead in the data area is 16 bytes."
.entry "The number of possible keys is limited by the address space of"
the process, or somewhat over 200 million, whatever comes first.
.entry "Storage of numbers is done in big endian byte order (`network byte"
order'). Databases are portable between hosts with different byte
orders.
.entry "The size of the cache and the number of records in it are"
set at creation time.
.entry "The cache is cleaned up automatically, removing old records if"
there's not enough space for data or records.
.entry "Deletions are supported."
.entry "Multiple readers and writers are supported, provided that the"
applications lock to database.
.entry "Keys need not be unique."

.section "TOOLS"
.manlink dcachemake.html dcachemake(1) 
is used to create a new cache with or without elements, and to
add a large number of new elements to an existing cache.
.manlink dcachedump.html dcachedump(1) 
can dump a complete cache file.
.paragraph
.manlink dcacheadd.html dcacheadd(1) 
may be used to add a single record to the cache.
.br
.manlink dcachedel.html dcachedel(1) 
is the tool used to delete a record from the cache.
.br
.manlink dcacheget.html dcacheget(1) 
retrieves records from the cache.
.paragraph
.manlink dcachelist.html dcachelist(1) 
lists the content of a cache, and
.manlink dcachestats.html dcachestats(1) 
prints cache statistics.
.manlink dcachereplay.html dcachereplay(1) 
tries to finish incomplete transactions on a cache file.
